### Beta
[![stability-beta](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-beta-33bbff.svg)](https://github.com/mkenney/stability-badges#beta)

Code is in the process of settling, but has not yet had sufficient real-world testing to be considered mature. Backwards-compatibility will be maintained if reasonable.

### Mature
[![stability-mature](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-mature-008000.svg)](https://github.com/mkenney/stability-badges#mature)
