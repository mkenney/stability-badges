### Deprecated
[![stability-deprecated](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-deprecated-red.svg)](https://github.com/mkenney/stability-badges#deprecated)

Changes are planned. Do not rely on it. Use of the feature may cause warnings. Backwards compatibility should not be expected.

### Experimental
[![stability-experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-experimental-orange.svg)](https://github.com/mkenney/stability-badges#experimental)

### Unstable
[![stability-unstable](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-unstable-yellow.svg)](https://github.com/mkenney/stability-badges#unstable)

The API is in the process of settling, but has not yet had sufficient real-world testing to be considered stable. Backwards-compatibility will be maintained if reasonable.

### Stable
[![stability-stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-stable-green.svg)](https://github.com/mkenney/stability-badges#stable)

The API has proven satisfactory, but cleanup in the underlying code may cause minor changes. Backwards-compatibility is guaranteed.

### Frozen
[![stability-frozen](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-frozen-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/mkenney/stability-badges#frozen)

This API has been tested extensively in production and is unlikely to ever have to change.

### Locked
[![stability-locked](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-locked-blue.svg)](https://github.com/mkenney/stability-badges#locked)
